# Rails Vine

Sane rails defaults with some of the most often included gems and configurations.

## Getting Started

Vine is a Rails template, so you pass it in as an option when creating a new app.

#### Creating a new app

```bash

rails new myapp -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmartel/vine/master/template.rb
```

Or if you have downloaded this repo, you can reference template.rb locally:

```bash
rails new myapp -m template.rb
```

#### Cleaning up

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf myapp
```
